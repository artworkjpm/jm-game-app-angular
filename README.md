## Idea for game

Show 3 photos of real objects, show one cartoon picture of one of the items.
Sally needs to touch what photo is the cartoon image.

For each touch there should be a voice trigering the name of the item touched, and when the page loads a voice that says the item

//Get images

///Cartoons
Car, bicycle, fork, spoon, plate, shoes, hat, carrito, bottle, glass, sunglasses

///photos
